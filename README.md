# My-travel-maps

My-travel-maps is a desktop application designed to help you record and visualize your travels on an interactive world map.
Once installed locally on your computer, the app displays a blank world map where you can place interactive bubbles. Each bubble represents a trip and can contain text, photos, and other information to capture your travel memories in a personalized way.
